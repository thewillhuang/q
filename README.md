# Q
a queue system for resolving both online and walk-in patients for a major hospital in Foshan China. Purely just for fun.

#Stack
this example is build with react, bootstrap, express, node, mongodb

# Automation and testing stack
This gulp stack was modified from gulp starter to suit my own needs to browserify, reactify, watchify, and livereload with browser sync. In addition, it will optimize all images and watch for any changes automatically. Sass/Scss will be compiled down to css


# Run

```
$ npm install
```

Optimize all css, js, and html.
```
$ gulp production
```
Should lead you to a 100/100 score on pageSpeed
